 ## Introduction 
This repository is for exploring new ideas and developing early prototypes of various OData stacks.

### OData Connected Service Provider

* [Source](https://github.com/OData/lab/tree/master/ODataConnectedService)
* [Visual Studio Extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b343d0eb-6493-44c2-b558-13a0408d013f)
* FAQ
  **Question**: The extension module is not loaded when debugging in the Visual Studio experimental instance, or it is not listed as part of the "Add Connected Service" options
  **Workaround**: Disable signing by going to the Project Properties > Signing and disabling both "Sign the assembly" and "Delay sign only" options.
  
  **Question**: In Visual Studio 2017, upon configuring the service endpoint in the OData Connected Services extension and clicking "Finish", I get an error message that says "Value cannot be null.\r\nParameter name: path1".  
  **Workaround**: Download the [Microsoft WCF ToolKit](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/C/A/1CAA41C7-88B9-42D6-9E11-3C655656DAB1/WcfDataServices.exe) and install it. Then go to the registry and find the following key: `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Microsoft WCF Data Services]`. Create a duplicate of "VS 2010 Tooling" (if this doesn't exist, use "5.6" instead) named "VS 2014 Tooling". Then try again. (Special thanks to [mohsenno1](https://github.com/mohsenno1) for pointing this out.)
  
  **Question**: In Visual Studio 2017, upon configuring the service endpoint in the OData Connected Services extension and clicking "Finish", I get an error message that says "Cannot access".  
  **Workaround**: Most reported issues for this error are related to authentication-based endpoints. This extension does not currently support authentication. To work around, download the metadata as a text file from the endpoint and then point the OData Connected Services URI to the downloaded file.

#### Unit Tests

The `ODataConnectedService.Tests.sln` contains the unit tests for the OData connected service. The folder structure of the tests mirrors the folder structre
of the `ODataConnectedService` project. The base namespace for tests is `Microsoft.OData.ConnectedService.Tests`. Furthermore each test class has the same name
as the class it is testing, followed by the suffix `Test`.

Example: for some class `Microsoft.OData.ConnectedService.X.Y` located in `src\X\Y.cs`,
the test class would be `Microsoft.OData.Tests.ConnectedService.Tests.X.YTest` located in `test\X\YTest.cs`
